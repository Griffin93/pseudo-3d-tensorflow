## Introduction
Pseudo-3d-residual-network is mainly used for action recognition,paper url:

Here is the tensorflow version.
## Preparing your own dataset.
-----------------
  Suppose you are about to use UCF dataset.Firstly converting videos to images is necessary.
  To do this,you could run codes like follows:(Suppose UCF dataset is in the same directory as the code-files.)
  *./process_video2image.sh UCF101   
  *And next step,you should get the train.list and test.list which you would fetch afterwards for training data and test
  *data individually:(number 5 indicates the possibility )
  *./process_gettxt.sh UCF101 5
